in this project i decided to check two great gui frameworks with python, Tkinter & DearPyGui 
we almost know tkinter but DearPyGui? its new to us 

I think DearPyGui is moderner and easier to work, you spend one day to save many days 

in this project i created very Simple Login with phone username and sonsored password and one button
when you clicked on login it prints your info and close project
